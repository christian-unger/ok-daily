# OKDAILY

Simple Todo App for daily habits. No database or API calls, just uses localStorage to keep track of whether you've done your habits for the day

Built with React 18 (vite), TypeScript, and theming with Styled Components (click on the tabs on top to change theme)

Try using the enter, delete, and arrow keys to move around the app with your keyboard

Any feedback is always appreciated!

to run locally:

- fork or clone to a local repository
- install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`
- run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start the local development server
- vite defaults to port 5173 so the app should be working at `http://localhost:5173/`
